# Fitness App - Frontend

The frontend of **Andy Fitness App**, a MERN based fitness tracking application.
Built with **React**, **React Router**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, protected with Clerk and deployed on **Netlify**.
This application help users manage their health and fitness journey with tools such as:
  - **BMI & BMR Calculator** - calculate personal health metrices
  - **Healthy Recipes** - discover recipes with detailed preparation steps
  - **User Dashboard** - track calories, macros, steps, exercise time, and weight over time
